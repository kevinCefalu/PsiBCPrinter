# PsiBCPrinter
This is my take on a portable business card printer using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+, an Adafruit Nano Thermal Printer, and too much time. 

Please note that at this current state, I am using the Adafruit Thermal Printer python implementation found in [Python Thermal Printer](https://github.com/adafruit/Python-Thermal-Printer).
